1.  Open the Dirk Wiggler folder on the desktop if it is not already open. Check that the wind tunnel switch is OFF. 



2.  Right click "diggler" and select "Edit with IDLE".  Two windows will open, diggler.py and a Python shell.  Go into the Python shell. 



3.  Import diggler as follows:

>>> import diggler



4.  Create a Replicates object:

>>> myreplicates = diggler.Replicates("mymodelname",5)

Where the model name will be mymodelname and it will do 5 replicates.



5.  Zero the model and check its position is zero and that it is placed in the tunnel correctly:

>>> myreplicates.tunnel.Sting.gohome()



6.  If you are happy with everything, turn the wind tunnel switch to ON and tell the Replicates object to go:

>>> myreplicates.go()

It will automatically do -15 to 90, 5 replicates, placing them in separate directories on the desktop and using the file naming convention. 



6.  When done, add the directory names into the log.
